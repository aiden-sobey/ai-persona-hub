```

Or make use of `~/.cgem/config.json`:
```json
{
  "providers": {
    "openai": {
      "apiKey": "your-openai-key"
    },
    "anthropic": {
      "apiKey": "your-anthropic-key"
    },
    "google": {
      "apiKey": "your-google-key"
    }
  },

## Development

First, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:aiden-sobey/ai-persona-hub.git
cd ai-persona-hub
npm install
```

To run the project:

```bash
# Watch mode during development
npm run dev

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run directly with Node.js
npm start
```

## Profiles

Profiles are stored in `./profiles/` directory

### Structure

Profiles are stored as JSON files with the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "profile-id",
  "name": "Profile Name",
  "systemPrompt": "Your custom system prompt...",
  "maxTokens": 1000,
  "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "lastUsed": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Architecture

Built with:

- **Mastra AI Framework** - Unified AI provider interface
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Commander.js** - CLI framework
- **Inquirer.js** - Interactive prompts
- **Chalk** - Terminal colors

The application uses Mastra's unified provider API to seamlessly switch between different AI providers while maintaining a consistent interface. The new architecture separates concerns: profiles store system prompts, while provider/model selection is handled globally, allowing maximum flexibility.
